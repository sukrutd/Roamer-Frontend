# What is MERN?

-   M stands for MongoDB which is a database solution
-   E stands for Express which is a web application framework for Node.js
-   R stands for ReactJS which is a client-side JavaScript Library
-   N stands for Node.js which is a server-side JavaScript Runtime

## Express

It is a Node.js framework which simplifies server-side code and logic. It is entirely middleware-based. It funnels incoming requests through functions which are commonly called middlewares.

## MongoDB

It is a NoSQL database which stores "Documents" in "Collections" (instead of "Records" in "Tables" as in SQL). It enforces no Schema or Relations.

## API (Application Programming Interface)

1. REST API

    REST stands for Representational State Transfer. It uses a combination of different URLs and HTTP verbs (commonly known as Endpoints) for different actions.

2. GraphQL API

    It uses one URL and one HTTP verb (POST endpoint) that accepts query commands. A query expression identifies a resource and action.
